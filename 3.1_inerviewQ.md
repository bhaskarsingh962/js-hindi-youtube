## JavaScript Functions ‚Äî Full Notes (Interview-Ready)
## üè∑Ô∏è 1. Function Statement (a.k.a Function Declaration)
‚û§ Definition:

A function statement (or function declaration) defines a function with a name using the function keyword.

‚û§ Syntax:
function a() {
  console.log("Function a is called");
}
a(); // ‚úÖ Works

## ‚û§ Key Point (Hoisting):

Function declarations are hoisted completely ‚Äî meaning they are available before their definition in the code.

a(); // ‚úÖ Works (due to hoisting)
function a() {
  console.log("Function a is called");
}


## ‚úÖ In Interview:

Function declarations are hoisted with both their name and definition, so you can call them before they are declared.

## üè∑Ô∏è 2. Function Expression
‚û§ Definition:

A function expression is when a function is assigned to a variable.

var b = function() {
  console.log("b is called");
};
b(); // ‚úÖ Works after definition

‚û§ Key Point (Hoisting):

Function expressions are not hoisted like function declarations.

During hoisting, the variable is hoisted but initialized as undefined, so calling it before assignment gives an error.

b(); // ‚ùå TypeError: b is not a function
var b = function() {
  console.log("b is called");
};


‚úÖ In Interview:

Function expressions are not hoisted with their function body, only the variable is hoisted (initialized to undefined).

## üè∑Ô∏è 3. Anonymous Function
‚û§ Definition:

A function without a name is called an anonymous function.

‚û§ Important Rule:

Anonymous functions cannot exist alone ‚Äî they must be assigned to a variable or passed as an argument.

const anonymous = function() {
  console.log("Anonymous function");
};
anonymous(); // ‚úÖ Works


‚ùå Invalid (will throw an error):

function() {
  console.log("This will create an error");
}


‚úÖ In Interview:

Anonymous functions are mostly used in callbacks, setTimeouts, or event listeners.

Example:

setTimeout(function() {
  console.log("Executed after 2s");
}, 2000);

## üè∑Ô∏è 4. Named Function Expression
‚û§ Definition:

A Named Function Expression is a function expression where the function itself has a name.

var z = function c(a, b) {
  console.log("Named Function Expression called");
};
z(3, 4);

‚û§ Key Points:

The function name (c) is local to that function‚Äôs scope ‚Äî it cannot be used outside.

You can‚Äôt call c() directly outside its definition.

z(); // ‚úÖ Works
c(); // ‚ùå ReferenceError: c is not defined


‚úÖ In Interview:

Named function expressions help in debugging (stack traces show function names instead of ‚Äúanonymous‚Äù).

## üè∑Ô∏è 5. First-Class Functions (a.k.a First-Class Citizens)
‚û§ Definition:

In JavaScript, functions are treated like variables.
This means you can:

Pass a function as an argument.

Return a function from another function.

Assign a function to a variable.

## ‚û§ 1Ô∏è‚É£ Passing a Function as an Argument
function greet(callback) {
  console.log("Hello!");
  callback();
}

## greet(function() {
  console.log("Callback function executed");
});


‚úÖ Output:

Hello!
Callback function executed


## ‚úÖ In Interview:

JavaScript functions are first-class because they can be passed as values.

## ‚û§ 2Ô∏è‚É£ Returning a Function from Another Function
function outer() {
  return function inner() {
    console.log("Inner function returned from outer");
  };
}

const result = outer(); // outer() returns inner()
result(); // Calls inner()


‚úÖ Output:

## Inner function returned from outer


‚úÖ In Interview:

Returning functions allows creation of closures, currying, and modular reusable code.

Concept	Definition	                      Hoisting Behavior	Example
Function Declaration	Named function defined using function	Fully hoisted	function a(){}

Anonymous Function	Function with no name, used as value	Used only when assigned or passed	setTimeout(function(){})

‚ö° Interview Quick Recap

## ‚úÖ Question 1: Difference between function declaration and function expression?
Answer:
Declaration is hoisted completely.

Expression is assigned to variable, so only variable name is hoisted, not function body.

## ‚úÖ Question 2: What is an anonymous function?
Answer:
A function without a name, often used as callback or inside expressions.

## ‚úÖ Question 3: Can you explain first-class functions?
Answer:
In JavaScript, functions are first-class citizens ‚Äî they can be assigned to variables, passed as parameters, or returned from other functions.

## ‚úÖ Question 4: Why use named function expressions?
Answer:
For better debugging and recursive calls within the same function.
