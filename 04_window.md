## üîπ window and this in JavaScript
## 1. The window object

In browsers, window is the global object.

It represents the browser window that contains the DOM, BOM, and global variables/functions.

Any variable declared with var in the global scope automatically becomes a property of the window object.

üëâ Example:

var a = 10;
console.log(window.a); // 10
console.log(window);   // prints huge Window object (DOM, localStorage, etc.)

## 2. The this keyword

this refers to the context in which a function/statement is executed.

In global scope (non-strict mode), this refers to the window object.

Inside a function, this depends on how the function is called:

Normal function call ‚Üí this = window (in browsers).

With "use strict" ‚Üí this = undefined.

In an object method ‚Üí this = the object.

In an event handler ‚Üí this = the element that triggered the event.

In arrow functions ‚Üí this is lexically bound (inherits from parent scope).

üëâ Example (global scope):

console.log(this === window); // true (in browsers)

3. Your Example Explained

Code:

var a = 10;
function b() {
  var x = 10;
}
console.log(window.a);
console.log(a);
console.log(this.a);

Step by Step:

var a = 10;

Declares global variable a.

Becomes a property of window: window.a = 10.

function b() { var x = 10; }

Function b stored in memory.

Variable x is function-scoped, not added to window.

console.log(window.a); ‚Üí 10
Because global a is attached to window.

console.log(a); ‚Üí 10
Refers to global variable.

console.log(this.a); ‚Üí 10
In global scope, this = window, so same as window.a.

‚úÖ Final Output:

10
10
10

## 4. If You Use let or const Instead
let a = 10;
console.log(window.a); // undefined ‚ùå
console.log(a);        // 10 ‚úÖ
console.log(this.a);   // undefined ‚ùå


üëâ Reason:

Variables declared with let and const are stored in the Script scope, not added as properties of the window object.

Only var attaches to window.

## 5. When We Run an Empty JS File

If you just open browser console and type:

console.log(window);


You‚Äôll see a huge object with:

Browser APIs (DOM, localStorage, fetch, setTimeout, etc.)

Global properties

All var-declared globals.

üëâ Interview Tip:

In a browser, the global execution context creates the window object. In Node.js, it creates the global object. In ES2020 modules, the global object is accessible via globalThis.

‚úÖ Interview-Ready Notes
Difference between window, this, and global variables:

window ‚Üí The global object in browsers.

this ‚Üí Refers to current execution context. In global scope, same as window.

Global variable (var) ‚Üí Automatically becomes property of window.

Global variable (let/const) ‚Üí Does not attach to window.

üëâ Example:

var x = 5;
let y = 10;
console.log(window.x); // 5
console.log(window.y); // undefined
